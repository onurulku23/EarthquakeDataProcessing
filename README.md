# EarthquakeDataProcessing

## Introduction

I am studying Earthquake Engineering, and we had the assignment to process Samos Earthquake raw acceleration data, 30 October 2020 - the Aegean Sea, which are obtained from stations within 100 km of the epicenter to calculate some important measures such as Arias Intensity, Cumulative Absolute Velocity, and Significant Duration. These parameters are significant to determine the destructiveness of an earthquake. While speaking of the destructiveness of an earthquake, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) is one of the most used intensity scales in the World. In this case, Tselentis and Danciu (2008) propose an equation to calculate MMI with a dataset generated from earthquakes that happened in Greece during the period between 4 November 1973 and 7 September 1999. In addition to this, Sandıkkaya and Akkar(2016) presented a new approach to predict Arias Intensity, Cumulative Absolute Velocity, and Significant Duration. Thus, earthquake engineers can anticipate MMI when there is an earthquake with a moment magnitude of a value by using these predicted Arias Intensity. By the way, Samos Earthquake data can be retrieved from [AFAD](https://tadas.afad.gov.tr/) 

In that project, I downloaded raw earthquake data for each station from [AFAD](https://tadas.afad.gov.tr/) and implemented baseline correction for each station and each component of the earthquake. In the codes, everything that I did can be seen easily. Besides, I prepared a report to share my opinions, comments, and information. 

I am planning to develop this bunch of codes whenever I learn new information. Also, if you would like to contribute these codes, I will be grateful.
